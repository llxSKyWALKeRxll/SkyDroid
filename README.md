I am currently working on an android application as a part of the training course "Android Application Development", which is conducted by Internshala.  
So far, I am finding android app development to be quite easy, understandable and fun as most of the concepts being used here are the concepts that I have already studied before in Java and HTML.  
The web development course and project that I did recently is really helping me out here as Kotlin & Java and XML & HTML go hand in hand.  
I am really excited to build a useful and productive application from the knowledge that I will have after the completion of this course.  
This is my first application on Android.
